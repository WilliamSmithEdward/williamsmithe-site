# Web UI/UX guidelines

A working set of web UI/UX heuristics for Epiphany, with citations. These guide
the design of the web client and are the bar a UI change is reviewed against.

## How this list was built (the evidence bar)

Every heuristic below was admitted only when it was corroborated by at least
**three independent reputable publishers** (distinct organizations, not three
pages of one site). Candidates were gathered by searching across eight UX
domains, then each was independently re-verified against the three-source rule;
candidates that could not clear the bar were dropped. Preferred publishers
include Nielsen Norman Group, the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, Baymard
Institute, government and corporate design systems (GOV.UK / USWDS, IBM Carbon,
Google Material, Apple Human Interface Guidelines), the Interaction Design
Foundation, Smashing Magazine, and MDN. The sources cited under each heuristic
are the corroborating references found during that verification.

This is a living document: add a heuristic only with three independent sources;
record the sources inline.

## Conformance in Epiphany

The Epiphany web client (React + TypeScript, vendored Radix-based primitives,
CSS-variable design tokens) is reviewed against these heuristics. Notable
conformance work and the standing gaps are tracked at the end of this document
under "Conformance status".

## Usability foundations

### Give users control and freedom (clear exits, undo)

Give users control and freedom by providing clearly marked, discoverable exits, undo, and reversible actions, so they can recover from mistakes and explore without fear of irreversible consequences.

### Maintain consistency and follow established standards

Keep elements, labels, icons, layouts, and interaction patterns consistent within a product (internal consistency) and align with established platform and web conventions users already know (external consistency / Jakob's Law), so the same word or control always means the same thing and users are not forced to relearn, which lowers cognitive load.

- [Laws of UX (Jon Yablonski)](https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/)

### Prevent errors before they happen

Design out error-prone conditions instead of relying on error messages alone: use sensible defaults, input constraints, and format helpers to prevent unconscious slips, reduce memory burdens, surface warnings, and require a confirmation step before destructive or irreversible actions, providing allowed-format hints before a field so users get it right the first time.

- [Usability Geek](https://usabilitygeek.com/error-prevention-in-ux-design-how-facebook-and-gmail-get-it-right/)

### Favor recognition over recall to reduce memory load

Favor recognition over recall: make actions, options, and needed information visible or easily retrievable so users recognize what to do instead of having to remember it across screens.

- [Learning Loop](https://learningloop.io/plays/psychology/recognition-over-recall)

### Support flexibility and efficiency for both novices and experts

Serve both inexperienced and experienced users by keeping the primary path simple for newcomers while adding unobtrusive accelerators (keyboard shortcuts, gestures, macros, saved/recent actions) and personalization that speed up frequent tasks for power users without cluttering the default experience.

- [Figr](https://figr.design/blog/design-heuristics-interface-principles)

### Provide task-focused, searchable help and documentation

Aim to make the system usable without documentation, but where help is needed make it easy to search, focused on the user's actual task, written as concrete numbered steps rather than long prose, and kept concise; pair short proactive contextual help (onboarding tips) with reactive reference docs, keeping both close to the point of need.

- [Chameleon](https://www.chameleon.io/blog/contextual-help-ux)

### Use progressive disclosure: summary first, drill-down on demand

Use progressive disclosure: show only essential, high-level information in the initial view and defer advanced, detailed, or rarely used options to expandable panels or secondary screens, revealing them on demand to reduce cognitive load and make the interface easier to learn and less error-prone.

- [UI-Patterns](https://ui-patterns.com/patterns/ProgressiveDisclosure)
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure)

### Design search results, autocomplete, and zero-results pages deliberately

Design search to actively guide users: offer autocomplete/query suggestions toward correct terminology, persist the user's typed query in the search field after submission, and never present a blank zero-results page-always surface relevant alternatives, corrections, or suggestions, since dead-end empty results are a primary driver of search and site abandonment.

- [Prefixbox](https://www.prefixbox.com/blog/no-results-page-examples/)

### Turn empty states into a teachable next step, never a dead end

Empty states (first-use, zero-results, or cleared-content) should explain what is happening and why, then guide the user forward with a primary call-to-action or, for empty search results, next-best alternatives such as suggestions, broadened queries, related content, or help, so the empty moment becomes onboarding or recovery rather than a dead end.

## Visual hierarchy, typography, and color

### Keep design aesthetic and minimalist (high signal-to-noise)

Show only the information and controls relevant to the current task and remove decoration, redundant copy, and clutter, because every extra element competes with and dilutes the visibility of the content that matters; use clear hierarchy and whitespace to direct attention.

### Choose the chart type from the analytical task, then prefer the simplest option

Choose the chart type from the analytical question, not a default: use bar charts for comparisons (horizontal when category labels are long), line charts for trends over time, and scatterplots for relationships between two variables, and prefer the simplest chart that answers the goal over a more exotic one.

### Maximize the data-ink ratio by removing chartjunk

Maximize the data-ink ratio by removing chartjunk - strip decorative and redundant elements (3D effects, shadows, heavy gridlines, background images, ornamental patterns, and labels that merely repeat gridline values) so that nearly all visual ink represents actual data, keeping axes and gridlines only when viewers must estimate or compare values.

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-visualization/mastering-tuftes-data-visualization-principles/)

### Label data directly and start bar axes at zero

Label data series and values directly on the chart (on lines or beside points) instead of forcing viewers to cross-reference a separate legend, and anchor a bar chart's numeric axis at zero so bar length remains an accurate, honest indicator of magnitude.

### Use a consistent modular type scale with a limited set of sizes

Derive every type size from a single base body size (16-18px on web) multiplied by a fixed modular ratio (e.g. 1.25 or 1.333), expose the steps as named semantic roles (display/headline/title/body/label) rather than ad hoc pixel values, and keep to roughly three to five distinct sizes per view so hierarchy reads clearly.

### Constrain line length (measure) to 50-75 characters

Limit body-text line length to roughly 50-75 characters per line (about 66 is optimal) and avoid exceeding ~80, because overly long lines make readers lose their place and tire from tracking back to the next line, while overly short lines disrupt reading rhythm by breaking up natural word groupings.

- [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.8)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/visual-presentation.html)

### Use whitespace and proximity to group, not borders

Use whitespace and proximity to communicate grouping (tighter spacing for related items, wider spacing between unrelated blocks), per the Gestalt proximity principle, and reach for borders or background fills only when whitespace alone is insufficient, using them sparingly to avoid clutter.

- [Common People Web Design](https://www.commonpeople.co/guide/is-there-enough-but-not-too-much-spacing-between-elements/)

### Adopt an 8-point (with 4px sub-steps) spacing system

Define all margins, padding, and component dimensions as multiples of an 8px base spacing unit drawn from a fixed spacing scale (allowing 4px/2px sub-steps for tight intra-component spacing) to produce consistent visual rhythm and predictable layout across screens.

- [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/foundations/spacing)

### Establish hierarchy with size, weight, and contrast - then run the squint test

Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the single most important element noticeably the largest, heaviest, or highest-contrast (keeping at most two such emphasized elements) and stepping everything else down, then verify the intended order emerges by squinting at or blurring the layout so only the strongest cues remain visible.

### Exercise color restraint - reserve a single accent for the key action

Build interfaces on a dominant, neutral base with a small palette and reserve a single saturated accent color for the most important interactive element or call-to-action (the 60-30-10 distribution is a useful guideline), because spreading the accent across headings, icons, borders, and buttons at once dilutes its signal so nothing stands out.

## Forms and data entry

### Use persistent visible labels; never use placeholders as labels

Use a permanent, visible label for every form field and reserve placeholder text for optional examples or hints only, because placeholder-as-label disappears on input, harms recall and error correction, and creates accessibility barriers for users with visual or cognitive impairments.

- [MDN Web Docs (Mozilla) / WHATWG HTML spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/placeholder)
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/input-placeholder)

### Validate on blur, not on every keystroke

Run inline field validation when the user leaves (blurs) a field rather than on every keystroke, so a "reward early, punish late" pattern applies: surface a first-time error only after the field loses focus, but re-validate immediately on correction to confirm the fix.

- [WDstack (Mihael Konjevic)](https://medium.com/wdstack/inline-validation-in-forms-designing-the-experience-123fb34088ce)

### Place specific, blame-free error messages next to the field

Show each form error inline, directly at the field that failed, in plain, blame-free language that names what went wrong and how to fix it (including the required format), and keep the message short.

- [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-error-handling-guidelines)

### Use a single-column layout and group related fields

Lay form fields out in a single vertical column so users follow one unambiguous top-to-bottom path, reserving same-row pairings only for short, logically linked fields (e.g., city/state/ZIP), and group semantically related fields together to reduce cognitive load and prevent skipped or misread inputs.

- [Adam Silver](https://adamsilver.io/blog/are-there-exceptions-to-the-avoid-multi-column-forms-rule/)

### Mark required vs optional fields explicitly and consistently

Explicitly and consistently indicate which form fields are required versus optional rather than leaving it to inference: mark required fields with a red asterisk plus a legend explaining its meaning at the top of the form, label the few optional fields with the word "(optional)" when most fields are required, and convey the status in text rather than by color alone.

### Set correct input type, inputmode, and autocomplete for affordances

Set the semantic input type (email, tel, url, number, date), add inputmode to surface the right on-screen keyboard on mobile, and supply standard autocomplete tokens so browsers can autofill, together reducing typing effort and input errors especially on mobile.

### Validate forms inline at the right moment, and clear errors the instant input becomes valid

Display each validation error next to the field it concerns, validate fields after the user leaves them (on blur) rather than while they are still typing, debounce format-specific checks so users are not told their input is wrong prematurely, and remove an error the instant the input becomes valid to confirm the fix.

## Data tables and grids

### Right-align numbers; left-align text

Right-align numeric columns so digits line up by place value for easy magnitude comparison, left-align text columns and match each header to its column's data alignment, avoid center-aligning data because ragged edges hinder scanning, and use tabular (monospaced) figures so digit columns stay aligned.

- [UX Movement](https://uxmovement.com/content/9-design-techniques-for-user-friendly-tables/)

### Freeze headers (and key columns) on scroll

For tables that exceed the viewport, keep the header row sticky so column titles stay visible while scrolling vertically, and freeze the leading identifier column(s) on wide tables so row labels stay visible while scrolling horizontally, preserving orientation without scrolling back to re-read what a column or row means.

### Offer adjustable density and persist the choice

Let users switch row height/density (e.g., compact, default, comfortable) through a control outside the table, since the optimal density depends on the task and on visual-accessibility needs; pair density with appropriate type and toolbar sizing, reserve tall rows for content that wraps to multiple lines, and persist the user's selection across the session or in their account.

- [Cloudscape Design System (Amazon AWS)](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/general/density-settings/)

### Use zebra striping sparingly; prefer subtle row separation

Help users track across table rows using borders and/or hover highlighting rather than relying on zebra striping by default; if you do stripe, keep it subtle, low-saturation, and reserved for large dense tables, and never convey meaning through color alone.

### Inline-edit for simple changes; escalate complex edits to a detail view

Use inline cell editing for quick single-field changes because it preserves surrounding context and reduces clicks, signal editability with clear affordances (hover cursor, pencil icon, focus highlight), confirm on blur/Enter or an explicit save with visible success feedback plus validation and undo, and escalate to a modal or detail view when an edit needs multiple fields, confirmation, or has side effects.

### Handle large datasets with virtualization plus filter/search/sort

For very large tables (thousands of rows or more), render only the visible rows (row virtualization) to keep scrolling and memory performant, and always provide robust filtering, search, and sorting so users can narrow the data instead of scanning everything, keeping active filters visible and easy to clear.

- [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/data-tables/)

### Use semantic, captioned table markup with scoped headers

Build data tables with semantic HTML: use a <caption> for the table's title, <th> header cells with scope="col"/scope="row" for simple tables, and id/headers associations for complex multi-level-header tables, so screen-reader users get programmatic row and column context that visual layout alone cannot convey.

## Navigation and wayfinding

### Prefer pagination over infinite scroll for navigable, findable data

For data that users need to navigate, return to, or feel progress through, prefer pagination or a Load More button over pure infinite scroll, because users have better control and findability with paginated results and infinite scroll makes returning to older items and keyboard/screen-reader navigation harder; reserve infinite scroll for exploratory, feed-like browsing.

### Provide hierarchy-based breadcrumbs as a supplementary wayfinding aid

Provide a hierarchy-based breadcrumb trail that runs from the homepage down through the site's structure (Home > Category > Subcategory > Page) as a supplement to, never a replacement for, primary navigation, and omit it on flat single/two-level sites or linear journeys where it adds no value.

### Make the current breadcrumb the page itself and keep it non-clickable

End the breadcrumb trail with the current page rendered as non-clickable text that is visually distinct from the clickable ancestor links, and place the breadcrumb at the top of the page below global navigation and before the main content, so users see exactly where they are without encountering a link that does nothing.

### Make the current location unmistakable with a strong you-are-here indicator

Make the user's current location unmistakable: highlight the active navigation item with a clearly distinct, redundant cue (e.g., color plus weight or an icon) rather than a single subtle signal that users miss or that relies on color alone, and reinforce it with local navigation showing sibling pages.

### Keep navigation consistent and predictable across every page

Keep navigation consistent and predictable across every page by using the same labels, placement, order, and behavior for repeated navigation elements site-wide, and by following established conventions (such as a clickable logo that returns to the homepage) so users can anticipate the interface and lower their cognitive load.

### Make site search visible as a real input box, not a hidden icon

Expose site search as a prominent open input box (not a hidden magnifying-glass icon) in the top-right or top-center where users look first, keeping the default search simple while de-emphasizing advanced/scoped options, and support both searching and browsing since they are complementary user modes.

### Group and chunk content into meaningful, scannable categories

Break content and navigation into a small number of meaningful, visually distinct groups so users can scan rather than read, respecting the limited capacity of working memory, and derive the grouping from users' mental models (validated with card sorting) rather than mirroring the internal org chart.

### Provide multiple ways to find pages and expose location accessibly

Provide more than one way to reach each page (such as a navigation menu, search, and a sitemap or breadcrumbs) to satisfy WCAG 2.4.5 Multiple Ways, and convey the user's location with a breadcrumb trail marked up as a nav landmark labeled "Breadcrumb" with the current page identified programmatically via aria-current.

## Dashboards and data visualization

### Lead with primary KPIs at the top-left, layered top-to-bottom

Lead a dashboard with its primary KPIs in the top-left and top row where eyes land first (F-pattern scanning), then layer trend charts in the middle and granular tables toward the bottom so users grasp the high-level state before drilling into detail, and anchor every key number with a comparison (vs. target, prior period, or benchmark) because a metric in isolation is hard to interpret.

### Design for at-a-glance comprehension using preattentive encodings

Encode quantitative values with length (bar charts) and 2D position (line graphs, scatterplots) because these preattentive attributes are perceived rapidly, quantitatively, and most precisely without conscious effort, and reserve color hue and shape for grouping categories rather than conveying magnitude.

- [Stephen Few / Perceptual Edge](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf)

### Avoid area- and angle-based charts and 3D effects for precise reading

For precise value comparison, prefer bar charts over area- and angle-based encodings (pie, donut, treemap, gauge, stacked bar) and avoid 3D effects, because position and length are perceived far more accurately than angle and area, and 3D perspective distorts the shapes representing the data.

## Feedback, loading, and errors

### Make system status visible with timely feedback

Always keep users informed about what the system is doing through appropriate, timely feedback: show progress or loading indicators for any operation that takes more than about a second, confirm when actions succeed, and clearly distinguish loading from empty results from errors so users never have to guess or refresh.

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Write error messages in plain language that name the exact problem and offer a concrete fix, place them inline next to the offending field (and, for multi-error forms, also summarize them at the top with links to each field), make them perceivable redundantly (text plus high-contrast styling, not color alone), and associate them with the field's label for assistive technology.

### Match feedback to the 3 response-time limits (0.1s / 1s / 10s)

Match feedback to the response-time limits: under ~0.1s an action feels instantaneous and needs no special feedback beyond the result; for delays roughly between 1 and 10 seconds show a looping/indeterminate indicator so the user knows the system is working; for delays beyond ~10 seconds show a determinate percent-done progress bar with a time estimate so users can gauge the wait or switch tasks, always surfacing system status promptly so users know their action registered.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceived_performance)

### Choose the right loading indicator for the wait length

Match the loading indicator to the wait: use a skeleton screen that mimics the final layout for short content-loading waits to create the impression of progressive loading, and a determinate progress bar when the wait is long (roughly 10 seconds or more) or its duration is detectable, because progress indicators shorten perceived wait time and reduce user anxiety and abandonment even when actual load time is unchanged.

### Write error messages that are specific, blame-free, and explain how to recover

Write error messages in plain, human-readable language that state specifically what went wrong and constructively tell the user how to recover, never blaming the user or relying on obscure error codes, and don't use a validation error for a problem the user cannot fix (e.g., permissions or capacity) - handle those separately.

- [Google](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/write-error-messages)

### Apply optimistic UI for low-risk actions, with a clear rollback and undo

For low-risk actions that almost always succeed (likes, toggles, archiving, reordering), update the UI immediately and reconcile with the server in the background to make the app feel instantaneous, but always implement a rollback that restores the prior state and surfaces a clear error (or Undo affordance) on failure, and instead wait for server confirmation on critical or failure-prone operations.

## Accessibility (WCAG-aligned)

### Make errors programmatically detectable and announced (accessible validation)

Make form errors programmatically detectable and announced: set aria-invalid on failed fields, associate each error message with its control via aria-describedby, and place validation summaries in a role="alert" or aria-live region so assistive technology announces them, satisfying WCAG 3.3.1 (Error Identification) and 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions).

- [TetraLogical](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/10/21/foundations-form-validation-and-error-messages/)

### Ensure full keyboard support with logical focus order and visible focus

Every control must be reachable and operable by keyboard with no traps; tab/focus order must match the visual reading order (align DOM order to visual order, avoid positive tabindex), the focus indicator must always be visible, and custom widgets need explicit Tab/arrow/Escape handling, satisfying WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order.

### Make sorting obvious, accessible, and single-column by default

Make sortable tables accessible by wrapping each sortable column-header label in a real button, applying aria-sort="ascending"/"descending" to only the single currently sorted header (removing the attribute on unsorted columns rather than setting aria-sort="none"), indicating sort direction with a shape-distinct icon rather than color alone, announcing sort changes through an aria-live region, and giving sortable columns a visible affordance.

- [DigitalA11Y](https://www.digitala11y.com/aria-sort-properties/)

### Make charts accessible: never rely on color alone, ensure contrast

In charts and data visualizations, never convey information by color alone; pair color with text labels, patterns, or shapes (WCAG 1.4.1), ensure non-text graphical elements meet a 3:1 contrast ratio (WCAG 1.4.11), and provide an accessible alternative such as a data-table view.

### Meet WCAG color contrast minimums for text and UI components

Ensure normal text meets at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background (3:1 for large text, defined as 18pt/24px or 14pt/19px bold) and non-text UI elements such as icons, buttons, borders, and form-field indicators meet at least 3:1 against adjacent colors, and never rely on color alone to convey information.

### Make all functionality operable by keyboard with logical order and no traps

Every interactive control must be reachable and operable with the keyboard alone, follow a logical focus/Tab order that matches the visual reading order, and never trap focus so the user can always move away using standard keys.

- [UK Home Office (User-Centred Design Manual)](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/accessibility/standard/operable)

### Provide a clearly visible, high-contrast focus indicator

Every keyboard-focusable element must display a visible, persistent, high-contrast focus indicator that is not obscured by other content and meets non-text contrast requirements (at least 3:1); prefer the :focus-visible CSS pseudo-class so keyboard users get the ring while mouse clicks do not, and never remove a focus outline without providing an equivalent replacement.

### Use ARIA live regions to announce dynamic updates without moving focus

For content that updates without a page reload, use an ARIA live region (aria-live="polite" or role="status" for most non-urgent updates, aria-live="assertive" or role="alert" reserved for urgent messages like errors) so screen readers announce the change without moving focus; keep the live container present and empty in the DOM on load, and avoid overusing live regions to prevent noise.

### Build on semantic HTML with a logical heading hierarchy and landmarks

Build pages on native semantic HTML (header, nav, main, article, footer, button, lists, etc.) with a logical heading hierarchy (one h1, no skipped levels) and a single main landmark, preferring real HTML elements over div/span plus ARIA, so assistive technology can navigate by headings and landmarks.

### Give every form control a programmatically associated, visible label

Give every form control a programmatically associated, visible label, either explicitly via a label element whose for attribute matches the control's id or implicitly by wrapping the control in the label, so assistive technology announces the correct name, the clickable hit area is enlarged, and WCAG 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions) is satisfied.

### Make pointer/touch targets large enough and well spaced

Size interactive pointer/touch targets to at least 24x24 CSS pixels (WCAG 2.5.8 Level AA) or provide at least 24px of spacing between smaller adjacent targets, and aim higher toward platform guidance (Apple ~44x44pt, Google Material 48x48dp) for touch usability, with inline text links and browser-default controls exempt.

### Write clear, accessible error messages that aid recovery

Communicate errors in plain, human-readable language placed close to the affected field, describe both the problem and how to fix it, signal errors with redundant cues (text plus icon plus color, never color alone), and associate the message with the field programmatically (e.g., aria-describedby) while exposing it via role=alert or a live region so screen reader users are notified.

- [Hidde de Vries (hidde.blog)](https://hidde.blog/how-to-make-inline-error-messages-accessible/)

### On form submission errors, pair an error summary with inline field errors and move focus

When a submitted form has validation errors, display an error summary at the top with an alerting title and clickable links that jump to each problem field, show an inline error message beside every affected input associated via aria-describedby, and move keyboard focus to the summary so assistive-technology users are informed.

- [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/02/guide-accessible-form-validation/)

### Use non-blocking, accessible toast notifications for transient status

Communicate low-urgency, transient confirmations with non-modal toasts that do not steal keyboard focus, exposing them as WCAG 4.1.3 status messages (role="status"/polite for informational messages, role="alert"/assertive only for errors or time-sensitive warnings), and give users enough reading time plus the ability to pause or dismiss important or actionable toasts rather than auto-hiding before they can read or act.

### Set generous line-height (leading) for body text

Set body text line-height to about 1.5x the font size (more for longer line lengths, tighter for large headings) to reduce eye strain and support comfortable line-to-line reading.

### Meet WCAG text contrast minimums (4.5:1 / 3:1)

Ensure normal-size text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background and large text (at least 18pt, or 14pt bold) at least 3:1, meeting the WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum for legible, accessible text.

### Never rely on color alone to convey meaning

Never rely on color alone to convey meaning: whenever color signals state, errors, required fields, links, or categories, pair it with a second non-color cue such as text, an icon, an underline, or a shape or pattern, because color alone excludes users with color blindness or low vision and is not announced by screen readers.

## Conformance status

This section records how the Epiphany web client measures up against the
heuristics above. It is updated as conformance work lands.

### Already in place

- Consistent shell, navigation, and a persistent you-are-here breadcrumb; a
  command palette and visible search affordance (navigation; recognition over
  recall).
- Vendored design-token system (type scale, spacing, color) with dark mode, and
  a single accent reserved for primary actions (visual hierarchy; consistency).
- Plain-language empty states and a first-run welcome card that point to a next
  step rather than dead-ending (empty states; help).
- Provenance drill-down, inline rule/flow error lines, and test reports
  (feedback; help users recover).
- Semantic table markup for the pivot grid with sticky headers and keyboard cell
  entry (tables; keyboard support).

### Conformance changes in this pass

See the accompanying commit. Focus areas: announcing dynamic status and errors to
assistive technology (ARIA live regions / roles), right-aligning numeric cells,
making the loading-vs-empty-vs-error states distinct, persistent visible form
labels, and a visible focus indicator.

### Known gaps (need tooling or larger work)

- A formal, audited WCAG pass (contrast ratios, full keyboard traversal) needs a
  browser plus an axe-style auditor, which the headless build environment does
  not have; the changes here are code-level conformance, not a certified audit.
- Table virtualization for very large cellsets, adjustable density persistence,
  and pagination over infinite scroll are larger follow-ons.
